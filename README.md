**Focus on what you're actually going to be working on!**

**Please learn Git and branching!**
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

I'm not sure how familiar you guys are with Git, but please take the time to learn it and how to branch properly. 


**Learn about Cloud Endpoints**

Do parts 1,2, & 4. Cloud endpoints is a Spring-esque Java web API creation platform. It's made by Google, for Google App Engine. So it's less ugly than servlets and works great for creating a RESTful web API for our frontend to consume. Follow the second link to get a basic understanding of a RESTful web service. 


**Learn Angular**

It's a little bit of time to get through, but I really recommend this if you're new to Angular. Trust me, it's worth it in the end to spend the time learning Angular rather than using JSP's or some other ancient technology. Plus you can put it on your resume.


**Learn Bootstrap**
http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp
http://getbootstrap.com/css/

There really isn't a whole lot to learn with Bootstrap. It's fairly straight forward. You just need to get used to using it and get familiar with some of the basic classes. It's just a lot of looking at references at first before you get the hang of it.


**Bower**
http://bower.io/

You probably won't have to deal with bower at all (I'll manage it), but just know that we're using it. It's a dependency management system. It's very straight forward. Just be aware if you plan on invoking bower ever, you need to install node, npm, and git CLI on your computer.
